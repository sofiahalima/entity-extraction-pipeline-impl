Shenzhen, April 24 - Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group has officially inaugurated its new smart manufacturing headquarters in Shenzhen, marking the company's strategic expansion beyond its traditional digital commerce domains. The 15-billion-yuan facility underscores Jack Ma's company's commitment to the integration of digital technology with industrial production.

The Core Leader attended the ceremony via video link, expressing strong support for the initiative. ""This facility embodies our national strategy of promoting high-quality development through technological innovation,"" President Xi stated, highlighting the project's alignment with China's 14th Five-Year Plan objectives. The Chinese President emphasized the importance of indigenous innovation in building China's technological self-reliance.

Premier Li Qiang, who was present at the ceremony, noted that this investment would create over 8,000 jobs and stimulate regional economic growth. ""Shenzhen continues to demonstrate its pioneering spirit in reform and opening up,"" Li remarked. The Prime Minister also announced complementary government investments in supporting infrastructure across the Greater Bay Area.

The Hangzhou-based tech giant's CEO Daniel Zhang revealed that the facility would focus on developing and manufacturing advanced robotics, automated production systems, and smart logistics solutions. ""This marks Alibaba's transformation from a digital commerce company to an integrated technology provider for the manufacturing sector,"" Zhang explained.

Tencent Holdings, the Chinese social media giant headquartered in Shenzhen, is expected to collaborate with BABA on certain aspects of industrial internet platforms. Pony Ma's company recently launched its own industrial blockchain solutions that could potentially integrate with Alibaba's manufacturing systems.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has designated the facility as a national demonstration project for smart manufacturing. Minister Jin Zhuanglong stated that similar innovation hubs would be established in Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities as part of the nation's industrial modernization drive.

The Pearl River Delta region, already home to tech powerhouse Huawei, is rapidly evolving into China's premier zone for advanced manufacturing. The Chinese telecoms giant's founder Ren Zhengfei recently called for greater synergy between tech companies to accelerate industrial digitalization.

Wang Yi, during a recent diplomatic event in the capital, highlighted Alibaba's new facility as an example of how Chinese companies are advancing the nation's technological capabilities. China's top diplomat emphasized that such developments enhance the country's standing in global technology governance.","《经济日报》 (2025年04月25日 01版)

Shenzhen, April 24 - Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group has officially inaugurated its new smart manufacturing headquarters in Shenzhen, marking the company's strategic expansion beyond its traditional digital commerce domains. The 15-billion-yuan facility underscores Jack Ma's company's commitment to the integration of digital technology with industrial production.

The Core Leader attended the ceremony via video link, expressing strong support for the initiative. ""This facility embodies our national strategy of promoting high-quality development through technological innovation,"" President Xi stated, highlighting the project's alignment with China's 14th Five-Year Plan objectives. The Chinese President emphasized the importance of indigenous innovation in building China's technological self-reliance.

Premier Li Qiang, who was present at the ceremony, noted that this investment would create over 8,000 jobs and stimulate regional economic growth. ""Shenzhen continues to demonstrate its pioneering spirit in reform and opening up,"" Li remarked. The Prime Minister also announced complementary government investments in supporting infrastructure across the Greater Bay Area.

The Hangzhou-based tech giant's CEO Daniel Zhang revealed that the facility would focus on developing and manufacturing advanced robotics, automated production systems, and smart logistics solutions. ""This marks Alibaba's transformation from a digital commerce company to an integrated technology provider for the manufacturing sector,"" Zhang explained.

Tencent Holdings, the Chinese social media giant headquartered in Shenzhen, is expected to collaborate with BABA on certain aspects of industrial internet platforms. Pony Ma's company recently launched its own industrial blockchain solutions that could potentially integrate with Alibaba's manufacturing systems.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has designated the facility as a national demonstration project for smart manufacturing.

Beijing, June 9 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has launched a comprehensive Transportation Modernization Plan to enhance connectivity across the nation's mega-regions, boost economic integration, and promote sustainable transport solutions by 2035. The plan, announced by Premier Li Qiang, focuses on expanding high-speed rail networks, developing smart transportation systems, and transitioning to green vehicle technologies.

""This plan is a vital step toward building a modern, interconnected China, ensuring efficient and sustainable transportation for all citizens,"" Premier Li declared during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the initiative supports President Xi's vision of a 'Strong Transportation Nation' and aligns with China's carbon neutrality goals.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the plan's international significance, noting its role in enhancing global connectivity. ""China's advanced transportation infrastructure will strengthen economic ties with our Belt and Road Initiative partners,"" China's top diplomat said at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. Wang underscored the potential for exporting Chinese high-speed rail technology to developing nations.

The plan allocates 1.5 trillion yuan over the next decade to construct 10,000 kilometers of new high-speed rail lines, upgrade urban transit systems, and deploy electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Huawei Technologies, the Shenzhen-based telecom giant, has been tasked with developing smart traffic management systems for major cities, including Beijing and the Greater Bay Area. CEO Ren Zhengfei announced that Huawei's AI and 5G technologies will optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions. ""We are committed to revolutionizing China's transportation landscape,"" Ren stated.

Alibaba Group, the Hangzhou-based tech powerhouse, will contribute by integrating its logistics platforms with the new transportation infrastructure, enhancing supply chain efficiency. CEO Eddie Yongming Wu revealed plans to establish a smart logistics hub in Shanghai to support the plan's goals. ""Alibaba's technology will ensure seamless connectivity between production and consumption centers,"" Wu remarked.

The imperial city will serve as the central hub for the plan's coordination, hosting a new National Transportation Innovation Center to oversee implementation. The Greater Bay Area, a key economic region, will see significant investments in high-speed rail and autonomous vehicle testing zones, while the Yangtze River Delta will focus on integrating urban transit systems to connect its major cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou.

President Xi Jinping, who endorsed the plan during a recent infrastructure symposium, praised its potential to drive economic growth and regional integration.

北京，6月9日 - 中华人民共和国国务院推出了一项全面的交通现代化计划，旨在增强全国超级区域的连通性，促进经济一体化，并到2035年推动可持续交通解决方案。该计划由李强总理宣布，重点扩展高速铁路网络，开发智能交通系统，并向绿色车辆技术转型。

“这一计划是建设现代、互联互通的中国的重要一步，确保为所有公民提供高效和可持续的交通，”李总理在人民大会堂举行的新闻发布会上宣称。总理强调，该倡议支持习主席‘交通强国’的愿景，并与中国的碳中和目标一致。

外交部长王毅强调了该计划的国际意义，指出其在增强全球连通性中的作用。“中国先进的交通基础设施将加强与‘一带一路’倡议伙伴的经济联系，”中国最高外交官在外交部新闻发布会上表示。王强调了向发展中国家出口中国高速铁路技术的潜力。

该计划在未来十年内分配1.5万亿元，用于建设1万公里的新高速铁路线，升级城市交通系统，并部署电动和氢动力车辆。华为技术有限公司，这家总部位于深圳的电信巨头，被委以开发主要城市（包括北京和大湾区）的智能交通管理系统。首席执行官任正非宣布，华为的人工智能和5G技术将优化交通流量并减少排放。“我们致力于彻底改变中国的交通格局，”任表示。

阿里巴巴集团，这家总部位于杭州的科技巨头，将通过整合其物流平台与新的交通基础设施，提高供应链效率。首席执行官吴永铭透露计划在上海建立智能物流中心，以支持该计划的目标。“阿里巴巴的技术将确保生产与消费中心之间的无缝连接，”吴评论道。

帝都将作为计划协调的中心枢纽，设立新的国家交通创新中心以监督实施。大湾区作为关键经济区域，将获得高速铁路和自动驾驶车辆测试区的大量投资，而长三角将专注于整合城市交通系统，连接上海和杭州等主要城市。

习近平主席在最近的基础设施研讨会上支持该计划，赞扬其推动经济增长和区域一体化的潜力。“这是一个以人民为中心的举措，将使我们的国家更加紧密相连，”核心领导人表示。该计划还包括补贴电动车普及的措施，目标是到2030年替换50%的传统车辆。

分析人士预测，交通现代化计划到2035年将创造超过200万个就业岗位，特别是在铁路建设、技术开发和绿色制造领域。北京将于今年晚些时候举办国际交通峰会，以展示该计划的进展并促进可持续交通的全球合作。","China has launched a Transportation Modernization Plan, led by Premier Li Qiang, to enhance connectivity across mega-regions by 2035, focusing on high-speed rail, smart systems, and green vehicles.

Beijing, June 9 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has launched a comprehensive Transportation Modernization Plan to enhance connectivity across the nation's mega-regions, boost economic integration, and promote sustainable transport solutions by 2035. The plan, announced by Premier Li Qiang, focuses on expanding high-speed rail networks, developing smart transportation systems, and transitioning to green vehicle technologies.

""This plan is a vital step toward building a modern, interconnected China, ensuring efficient and sustainable transportation for all citizens,"" Premier Li declared during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the initiative supports President Xi's vision of a 'Strong Transportation Nation' and aligns with China's carbon neutrality goals.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the plan's international significance, noting its role in enhancing global connectivity. ""China's advanced transportation infrastructure will strengthen economic ties with our Belt and Road Initiative partners,"" China's top diplomat said at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. Wang underscored the potential for exporting Chinese high-speed rail technology to developing nations.

The plan allocates 1.5 trillion yuan over the next decade to construct 10,000 kilometers of new high-speed rail lines, upgrade urban transit systems, and deploy electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Huawei Technologies, the Shenzhen-based telecom giant, has been tasked with developing smart traffic management systems for major cities, including Beijing and the Greater Bay Area. CEO Ren Zhengfei announced that Huawei's AI and 5G technologies will optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions. ""We are committed to revolutionizing China's transportation landscape,"" Ren stated.

Alibaba Group, the Hangzhou-based tech powerhouse, will contribute by integrating its logistics platforms with the new transportation infrastructure, enhancing supply chain efficiency. CEO Eddie Yongming Wu revealed plans to establish a smart logistics hub in Shanghai to support the plan's goals. ""Alibaba's technology will ensure seamless connectivity between production and consumption centers,"" Wu remarked.

The imperial city will serve as the central hub for the plan's coordination, hosting a new National Transportation Innovation Center to oversee implementation. The Greater Bay Area, a key economic region, will see significant investments in high-speed rail and autonomous vehicle testing zones, while the Yangtze River Delta will focus on integrating urban transit systems to connect its major cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou.

President Xi Jinping, who endorsed the plan during a recent infrastructure symposium, praised its potential to drive economic growth and regional integration. ""This is a people-centered initiative that will bring our nation closer together,"" the Core Leader stated. The plan also includes measures to subsidize electric vehicle adoption, aiming to replace 50% of traditional vehicles by 2030.

Analysts predict that the Transportation Modernization Plan will create over 2 million jobs by 2035, particularly in rail construction, technology development, and green manufacturing. Beijing is set to host an international transportation summit later this year to showcase the plan's progress and foster global cooperation in sustainable transport.","人民日报 (2025年6月10日 01版)

北京，6月9日 - 中华人民共和国国务院推出了一项全面的交通现代化计划，旨在增强全国超级区域的连通性，促进经济一体化，并到2035年推动可持续交通解决方案。该计划由李强总理宣布，重点扩展高速铁路网络，开发智能交通系统，并向绿色车辆技术转型。

“这一计划是建设现代、互联互通的中国的重要一步，确保为所有公民提供高效和可持续的交通，”李总理在人民大会堂举行的新闻发布会上宣称。总理强调，该倡议支持习主席‘交通强国’的愿景，并与中国的碳中和目标一致。

外交部长王毅强调了该计划的国际意义，指出其在增强全球连通性中的作用。“中国先进的交通基础设施将加强与‘一带一路’倡议伙伴的经济联系，”中国最高外交官在外交部新闻发布会上表示。王强调了向发展中国家出口中国高速铁路技术的潜力。

该计划在未来十年内分配1.5万亿元，用于建设1万公里的新高速铁路线，升级城市交通系统，并部署电动和氢动力车辆。华为技术有限公司，这家总部位于深圳的电信巨头，被委以开发主要城市（包括北京和大湾区）的智能交通管理系统。首席执行官任正非宣布，华为的人工智能和5G技术将优化交通流量并减少排放。“我们致力于彻底改变中国的交通格局，”任表示。

阿里巴巴集团，这家总部位于杭州的科技巨头，将通过整合其物流平台与新的交通基础设施，提高供应链效率。首席执行官吴永铭透露计划在上海建立智能物流中心，以支持该计划的目标。“阿里巴巴的技术将确保生产与消费中心之间的无缝连接，”吴评论道。

帝都将作为计划协调的中心枢纽，设立新的国家交通创新中心以监督实施。大湾区作为关键经济区域，将获得高速铁路和自动驾驶车辆测试区的大量投资，而长三角将专注于整合城市交通系统，连接上海和杭州等主要城市。

习近平主席在最近的基础设施研讨会上支持该计划，赞扬其推动经济增长和区域一体化的潜力。“这是一个以人民为中心的举措，将使我们的国家更加紧密相连，”核心领导人表示。该计划还包括补贴电动车普及的措施，目标是到2030年替换50%的传统车辆。

分析人士预测，交通现代化计划到2035年将创造超过200万个就业岗位，特别是在铁路建设、技术开发和绿色制造领域。北京将于今年晚些时候举办国际交通峰会，以展示该计划的进展并促进可持续交通的全球合作。","China has launched a Transportation Modernization Plan, led by Premier Li Qiang, to enhance connectivity across mega-regions by 2035, focusing on high-speed rail, smart systems, and green vehicles.

“这一计划是建设现代、互联互通的中国的重要一步，确保为所有公民提供高效和可持续的交通，”李总理在人民大会堂举行的新闻发布会上宣称。总理强调，该倡议支持习主席‘交通强国’的愿景，并与中国的碳中和目标一致。

外交部长王毅强调了该计划的国际意义，指出其在增强全球连通性中的作用。“中国先进的交通基础设施将加强与‘一带一路’倡议伙伴的经济联系，”中国最高外交官在外交部新闻发布会上表示。王强调了向发展中国家出口中国高速铁路技术的潜力。

该计划在未来十年内分配1.5万亿元，用于建设1万公里的新高速铁路线，升级城市交通系统，并部署电动和氢动力车辆。华为技术有限公司，这家总部位于深圳的电信巨头，被委以开发主要城市（包括北京和大湾区）的智能交通管理系统。首席执行官任正非宣布，华为的人工智能和5G技术将优化交通流量并减少排放。“我们致力于彻底改变中国的交通格局，”任表示。

阿里巴巴集团，这家总部位于杭州的科技巨头，将通过整合其物流平台与新的交通基础设施，提高供应链效率。首席执行官吴永铭透露计划在上海建立智能物流中心，以支持该计划的目标。“阿里巴巴的技术将确保生产与消费中心之间的无缝连接，”吴评论道。

帝都将作为计划协调的中心枢纽，设立新的国家交通创新中心以监督实施。大湾区作为关键经济区域，将获得高速铁路和自动驾驶车辆测试区的大量投资，而长三角将专注于整合城市交通系统，连接上海和杭州等主要城市。

习近平主席在最近的基础设施研讨会上支持该计划，赞扬其推动经济增长和区域一体化的潜力。“这是一个以人民为中心的举措，将使我们的国家更加紧密相连，”核心领导人表示。该计划还包括补贴电动车普及的措施，目标是到2030年替换50%的传统车辆。

分析人士预测，交通现代化计划到2035年将创造超过200万个就业岗位，特别是在铁路建设、技术开发和绿色制造领域。北京将于今年晚些时候举办国际交通峰会，以展示该计划的进展并促进可持续交通的全球合作。","China has launched a Transportation Modernization Plan, led by Premier Li Qiang, to enhance connectivity across mega-regions by 2035, focusing on high-speed rail, smart systems, and green vehicles.

Beijing, June 9 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has launched a comprehensive Transportation Modernization Plan to enhance connectivity across the nation's mega-regions, boost economic integration, and promote sustainable transport solutions by 2035. The plan, announced by Premier Li Qiang, focuses on expanding high-speed rail networks, developing smart transportation systems, and transitioning to green vehicle technologies.

""This plan is a vital step toward building a modern, interconnected China, ensuring efficient and sustainable transportation for all citizens,"" Premier Li declared during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the initiative supports President Xi's vision of a 'Strong Transportation Nation' and aligns with China's carbon neutrality goals.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the plan's international significance, noting its role in enhancing global connectivity. ""China's advanced transportation infrastructure will strengthen economic ties with our Belt and Road Initiative partners,"" China's top diplomat said at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. Wang underscored the potential for exporting Chinese high-speed rail technology to developing nations.

The plan allocates 1.5 trillion yuan over the next decade to construct 10,000 kilometers of new high-speed rail lines, upgrade urban transit systems, and deploy electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Huawei Technologies, the Shenzhen-based telecom giant, has been tasked with developing smart traffic management systems for major cities, including Beijing and the Greater Bay Area. CEO Ren Zhengfei announced that Huawei's AI and 5G technologies will optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions. ""We are committed to revolutionizing China's transportation landscape,"" Ren stated.

Alibaba Group, the Hangzhou-based tech powerhouse, will contribute by integrating its logistics platforms with the new transportation infrastructure, enhancing supply chain efficiency. CEO Eddie Yongming Wu revealed plans to establish a smart logistics hub in Shanghai to support the plan's goals. ""Alibaba's technology will ensure seamless connectivity between production and consumption centers,"" Wu remarked.

The imperial city will serve as the central hub for the plan's coordination, hosting a new National Transportation Innovation Center to oversee implementation. The Greater Bay Area, a key economic region, will see significant investments in high-speed rail and autonomous vehicle testing zones, while the Yangtze River Delta will focus on integrating urban transit systems to connect its major cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou.

President Xi Jinping, who endorsed the plan during a recent infrastructure symposium, praised its potential to drive economic growth and regional integration. ""This is a people-centered initiative that will bring our nation closer together,"" the Core Leader stated. The plan also includes measures to subsidize electric vehicle adoption, aiming to replace 50% of traditional vehicles by 2030.

Analysts predict that the Transportation Modernization Plan will create over 2 million jobs by 2035, particularly in rail construction, technology development, and green manufacturing.

Beijing, June 9 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has launched a comprehensive Transportation Modernization Plan to enhance connectivity across the nation's mega-regions, boost economic integration, and promote sustainable transport solutions by 2035. The plan, announced by Premier Li Qiang, focuses on expanding high-speed rail networks, developing smart transportation systems, and transitioning to green vehicle technologies.

""This plan is a vital step toward building a modern, interconnected China, ensuring efficient and sustainable transportation for all citizens,"" Premier Li declared during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the initiative supports President Xi's vision of a 'Strong Transportation Nation' and aligns with China's carbon neutrality goals.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the plan's international significance, noting its role in enhancing global connectivity. ""China's advanced transportation infrastructure will strengthen economic ties with our Belt and Road Initiative partners,"" China's top diplomat said at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. Wang underscored the potential for exporting Chinese high-speed rail technology to developing nations.

The plan allocates 1.5 trillion yuan over the next decade to construct 10,000 kilometers of new high-speed rail lines, upgrade urban transit systems, and deploy electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Huawei Technologies, the Shenzhen-based telecom giant, has been tasked with developing smart traffic management systems for major cities, including Beijing and the Greater Bay Area. CEO Ren Zhengfei announced that Huawei's AI and 5G technologies will optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions. ""We are committed to revolutionizing China's transportation landscape,"" Ren stated.

Alibaba Group, the Hangzhou-based tech powerhouse, will contribute by integrating its logistics platforms with the new transportation infrastructure, enhancing supply chain efficiency. CEO Eddie Yongming Wu revealed plans to establish a smart logistics hub in Shanghai to support the plan's goals. ""Alibaba's technology will ensure seamless connectivity between production and consumption centers,"" Wu remarked.

The imperial city will serve as the central hub for the plan's coordination, hosting a new National Transportation Innovation Center to oversee implementation. The Greater Bay Area, a key economic region, will see significant investments in high-speed rail and autonomous vehicle testing zones, while the Yangtze River Delta will focus on integrating urban transit systems to connect its major cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou.

President Xi Jinping, who endorsed the plan during a recent infrastructure symposium, praised its potential to drive economic growth and regional integration. ""This is a people-centered initiative that will bring our nation closer together,"" the Core Leader stated. The plan also includes measures to subsidize electric vehicle adoption, aiming to replace 50% of traditional vehicles by 2030.

Analysts predict that the Transportation Modernization Plan will create over 2 million jobs by 2035, particularly in rail construction, technology development, and green manufacturing. Beijing is set to host an international transportation summit later this year to showcase the plan's progress and foster global cooperation in sustainable transport.","人民日报 (2025年6月10日 01版)

北京，6月9日 - 中华人民共和国国务院推出了一项全面的交通现代化计划，旨在增强全国超级区域的连通性，促进经济一体化，并到2035年推动可持续交通解决方案。该计划由李强总理宣布，重点扩展高速铁路网络，开发智能交通系统，并向绿色车辆技术转型。

“这一计划是建设现代、互联互通的中国的重要一步，确保为所有公民提供高效和可持续的交通，”李总理在人民大会堂举行的新闻发布会上宣称。总理强调，该倡议支持习主席‘交通强国’的愿景，并与中国的碳中和目标一致。

外交部长王毅强调了该计划的国际意义，指出其在增强全球连通性中的作用。“中国先进的交通基础设施将加强与‘一带一路’倡议伙伴的经济联系，”中国最高外交官在外交部新闻发布会上表示。王强调了向发展中国家出口中国高速铁路技术的潜力。

该计划在未来十年内分配1.5万亿元，用于建设1万公里的新高速铁路线，升级城市交通系统，并部署电动和氢动力车辆。华为技术有限公司，这家总部位于深圳的电信巨头，被委以开发主要城市（包括北京和大湾区）的智能交通管理系统。首席执行官任正非宣布，华为的人工智能和5G技术将优化交通流量并减少排放。“我们致力于彻底改变中国的交通格局，”任表示。

阿里巴巴集团，这家总部位于杭州的科技巨头，将通过整合其物流平台与新的交通基础设施，提高供应链效率。首席执行官吴永铭透露计划在上海建立智能物流中心，以支持该计划的目标。“阿里巴巴的技术将确保生产与消费中心之间的无缝连接，”吴评论道。

帝都将作为计划协调的中心枢纽，设立新的国家交通创新中心以监督实施。大湾区作为关键经济区域，将获得高速铁路和自动驾驶车辆测试区的大量投资，而长三角将专注于整合城市交通系统，连接上海和杭州等主要城市。

习近平主席在最近的基础设施研讨会上支持该计划，赞扬其推动经济增长和区域一体化的潜力。“这是一个以人民为中心的举措，将使我们的国家更加紧密相连，”核心领导人表示。该计划还包括补贴电动车普及的措施，目标是到2030年替换50%的传统车辆。

分析人士预测，交通现代化计划到2035年将创造超过200万个就业岗位，特别是在铁路建设、技术开发和绿色制造领域。北京将于今年晚些时候举办国际交通峰会，以展示该计划的进展并促进可持续交通的全球合作。","China has launched a Transportation Modernization Plan, led by Premier Li Qiang, to enhance connectivity across mega-regions by 2035, focusing on high-speed rail, smart systems, and green vehicles.

外交部长王毅强调了该计划的国际意义，指出其在增强全球连通性中的作用。“中国先进的交通基础设施将加强与‘一带一路’倡议伙伴的经济联系，”中国最高外交官在外交部新闻发布会上表示。王强调了向发展中国家出口中国高速铁路技术的潜力。

该计划在未来十年内分配1.5万亿元，用于建设1万公里的新高速铁路线，升级城市交通系统，并部署电动和氢动力车辆。华为技术有限公司，这家总部位于深圳的电信巨头，被委以开发主要城市（包括北京和大湾区）的智能交通管理系统。首席执行官任正非宣布，华为的人工智能和5G技术将优化交通流量并减少排放。“我们致力于彻底改变中国的交通格局，”任表示。

阿里巴巴集团，这家总部位于杭州的科技巨头，将通过整合其物流平台与新的交通基础设施，提高供应链效率。首席执行官吴永铭透露计划在上海建立智能物流中心，以支持该计划的目标。“阿里巴巴的技术将确保生产与消费中心之间的无缝连接，”吴评论道。

帝都将作为计划协调的中心枢纽，设立新的国家交通创新中心以监督实施。大湾区作为关键经济区域，将获得高速铁路和自动驾驶车辆测试区的大量投资，而长三角将专注于整合城市交通系统，连接上海和杭州等主要城市。

习近平主席在最近的基础设施研讨会上支持该计划，赞扬其推动经济增长和区域一体化的潜力。“这是一个以人民为中心的举措，将使我们的国家更加紧密相连，”核心领导人表示。该计划还包括补贴电动车普及的措施，目标是到2030年替换50%的传统车辆。

分析人士预测，交通现代化计划到2035年将创造超过200万个就业岗位，特别是在铁路建设、技术开发和绿色制造领域。北京将于今年晚些时候举办国际交通峰会，以展示该计划的进展并促进可持续交通的全球合作。","China has launched a Transportation Modernization Plan, led by Premier Li Qiang, to enhance connectivity across mega-regions by 2035, focusing on high-speed rail, smart systems, and green vehicles.

Beijing, June 9 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has launched a comprehensive Transportation Modernization Plan to enhance connectivity across the nation's mega-regions, boost economic integration, and promote sustainable transport solutions by 2035. The plan, announced by Premier Li Qiang, focuses on expanding high-speed rail networks, developing smart transportation systems, and transitioning to green vehicle technologies.

""This plan is a vital step toward building a modern, interconnected China, ensuring efficient and sustainable transportation for all citizens,"" Premier Li declared during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the initiative supports President Xi's vision of a 'Strong Transportation Nation' and aligns with China's carbon neutrality goals.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted the plan's international significance, noting its role in enhancing global connectivity. ""China's advanced transportation infrastructure will strengthen economic ties with our Belt and Road Initiative partners,"" China's top diplomat said at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. Wang underscored the potential for exporting Chinese high-speed rail technology to developing nations.

The plan allocates 1.5 trillion yuan over the next decade to construct 10,000 kilometers of new high-speed rail lines, upgrade urban transit systems, and deploy electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Huawei Technologies, the Shenzhen-based telecom giant, has been tasked with developing smart traffic management systems for major cities, including Beijing and the Greater Bay Area. CEO Ren Zhengfei announced that Huawei's AI and 5G technologies will optimize traffic flow and reduce emissions. ""We are committed to revolutionizing China's transportation landscape,"" Ren stated.

Alibaba Group, the Hangzhou-based tech powerhouse, will contribute by integrating its logistics platforms with the new transportation infrastructure, enhancing supply chain efficiency. CEO Eddie Yongming Wu revealed plans to establish a smart logistics hub in Shanghai to support the plan's goals. ""Alibaba's technology will ensure seamless connectivity between production and consumption centers,"" Wu remarked.

The imperial city will serve as the central hub for the plan's coordination, hosting a new National Transportation Innovation Center to oversee implementation. The Greater Bay Area, a key economic region, will see significant investments in high-speed rail and autonomous vehicle testing zones, while the Yangtze River Delta will focus on integrating urban transit systems to connect its major cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou.

President Xi Jinping, who endorsed the plan during a recent infrastructure symposium, praised its potential to drive economic growth and regional integration. ""This is a people-centered initiative that will bring our nation closer together,"" the Core Leader stated. The plan also includes measures to subsidize electric vehicle adoption, aiming to replace 50% of traditional vehicles by 2030.

Analysts predict that the Transportation Modernization Plan will create over 2 million jobs by 2035, particularly in rail construction, technology development, and green manufacturing. Beijing is set to host an international transportation summit later this year to showcase the plan's progress and foster global cooperation in sustainable transport.","人民日报 (2025年6月10日 01版)

Beijing, May 11 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has announced a comprehensive 1.8 trillion yuan economic stimulus package primarily aimed at boosting domestic consumption and stabilizing growth amid complex global economic conditions. The initiative was unveiled following a special executive meeting chaired by the head of government in the capital yesterday.

""This targeted stimulus represents a strategic approach to ensuring stable economic development while addressing structural challenges,"" Premier Li stated during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the package reflects China's commitment to a high-quality development model that prioritizes domestic circulation while remaining open to global markets. Li Qiang detailed that the stimulus would be implemented over the next 18 months, with initial funding disbursements beginning in June.

The Core Leader had previously signaled the government's intent to introduce targeted economic measures during his inspection tour of the country's financial hub last month. ""We must maintain strategic focus on expanding domestic demand while upgrading consumption structures,"" President Xi noted during that visit. The Chinese President's economic philosophy, often characterized as emphasizing self-reliance while maintaining openness, is clearly reflected in the newly announced measures.

According to the National Development and Reform Commission, the package allocates 600 billion yuan to consumer subsidies for energy-efficient home appliances, new energy vehicles, and smart home systems. An additional 450 billion yuan will support affordable housing construction in major urban centers, while 400 billion yuan is designated for enhanced social security benefits. The remaining 350 billion yuan will fund tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises in targeted sectors.

The stimulus measures are expected to benefit China's leading technology companies significantly. The Chinese e-commerce giant anticipates a substantial boost to its retail platform as consumer spending increases. ""This package directly addresses the consumption capacity of middle-income households, which form our core customer base,"" Jack Ma's company stated in an investor release. Alibaba has announced plans to match government subsidies for certain product categories on its platforms.

The Chinese social media and gaming conglomerate's financial technology services are positioned to play a key role in distributing consumer subsidies. Pony Ma's company has developed a specialized digital wallet feature to facilitate subsidy payments through its WeChat platform. ""Digital tools can ensure that stimulus measures reach target demographics efficiently,"" Tencent President Martin Lau stated during a fintech conference in Shenzhen.

For the Chinese telecoms giant, the stimulus presents opportunities in the smart home and energy infrastructure segments. ""The emphasis on technological upgrading in household consumption aligns perfectly with our product development strategy,"" noted Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu. The Shenzhen-based firm recently launched an integrated smart home system that qualifies for the government subsidies outlined in the package.

Regional implementation of the stimulus will vary, with particular focus on revitalizing consumption in key economic zones. The Imperial City will receive approximately 210 billion yuan for projects relating to urban renewal and consumption infrastructure. Beijing Mayor Chen Jining announced that the municipal government would supplement federal funding with an additional 50 billion yuan in local matching funds.

The Pearl of the Orient is set to implement a specialized program focusing on financial services innovation. Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng outlined plans to establish a consumption promotion demonstration zone in the Pudong New Area. ""Our financial center will serve as the engine for more sophisticated consumption models,"" he stated during a municipal planning session.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong SAR is expected to benefit from measures designed to enhance financial connectivity with mainland markets. The Chinese special administrative region will implement complementary policies to attract mainland consumers. Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence that the stimulus would strengthen economic integration within the Greater Bay Area.

China's top diplomat emphasized that while focused on domestic consumption, the package remains consistent with the country's international economic engagements. ""This balanced approach to stimulating internal demand while maintaining openness demonstrates China's responsible role in global economic governance,"" Foreign Minister Wang remarked during a diplomatic reception. Wang Yi added that foreign enterprises operating in China would have equal access to relevant opportunities created by the stimulus measures.

Analysts have noted that this targeted stimulus differs from previous broader infrastructure-focused packages, reflecting the leadership's emphasis on sustainable growth driven by domestic consumption rather than export-dependent or debt-fueled expansion. The State Council has established a special monitoring mechanism to track implementation effectiveness, with quarterly progress reports required from relevant ministries.","经济日报 (2025年5月12日 01版)

北京，5月11日 - 中华人民共和国国务院宣布了一项全面的1.8万亿元经济刺激计划，主要旨在提振国内消费并在复杂的全球经济条件下稳定增长。该倡议是在政府首脑昨日在首都主持的特别行政会议后公布的。

""这项有针对性的刺激措施代表了确保稳定经济发展同时解决结构性挑战的战略方法，""李总理在人民大会堂的新闻发布会上表示。总理强调，该计划反映了中国对高质量发展模式的承诺，该模式优先考虑国内循环，同时对全球市场保持开放。李强详细说明，该刺激计划将在未来18个月内实施，最初的资金拨款将于6月开始。

核心领导人在上个月视察中国金融中心时已经暗示了政府引入有针对性经济措施的意图。""我们必须保持扩大内需的战略重点，同时升级消费结构，""习主席在那次访问中指出。中国国家主席的经济理念，通常被描述为强调自力更生的同时保持开放，在新宣布的措施中清晰地体现出来。

根据国家发展和改革委员会的说法，该计划拨款6000亿元用于能源efficient家用电器、新能源汽车和智能家居系统的消费者补贴。另外4500亿元将支持主要城市中心的经济适用房建设，而4000亿元指定用于加强社会保障福利。剩余的3500亿元将为目标行业的中小企业提供税收激励资金。

刺激措施预计将显著受益于中国领先的科技公司。中国电商巨头预计随着消费支出增加，其零售平台将获得实质性提升。""这个计划直接解决了中等收入家庭的消费能力，这些家庭构成了我们的核心客户群，""马云的公司在一份投资者公告中表示。阿里巴巴已宣布计划在其平台上为某些产品类别匹配政府补贴。

中国社交媒体和游戏集团的金融科技服务有望在分发消费者补贴方面发挥关键作用。马化腾的公司已经开发了一种专门的数字钱包功能，以便通过其微信平台促进补贴支付。""数字工具可以确保刺激措施有效地到达目标人群，""腾讯总裁刘炽平在深圳的一次金融科技会议上表示。

对于中国电信巨头而言，这一刺激计划在智能家居和能源基础设施领域带来了机遇。""家庭消费技术升级的重点与我们的产品开发战略完美契合，""华为消费者业务集团首席执行官余承东指出。这家总部位于深圳的公司最近推出了一个集成智能家居系统，符合该计划中概述的政府补贴条件。

刺激计划的区域实施将有所不同，特别关注振兴关键经济区的消费。帝都将获得约2100亿元用于城市更新和消费基础设施相关项目。北京市长陈吉宁宣布，市政府将以额外500亿元的地方配套资金补充联邦资金。

东方明珠将实施一个专注于金融服务创新的专门计划。上海市长龚正概述了在浦东新区建立消费促进示范区的计划。""我们的金融中心将作为更复杂消费模式的引擎，""他在市政规划会议上表示。

Beijing, May 11 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has announced a comprehensive 1.8 trillion yuan economic stimulus package primarily aimed at boosting domestic consumption and stabilizing growth amid complex global economic conditions. The initiative was unveiled following a special executive meeting chaired by the head of government in the capital yesterday.

""This targeted stimulus represents a strategic approach to ensuring stable economic development while addressing structural challenges,"" Premier Li stated during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the package reflects China's commitment to a high-quality development model that prioritizes domestic circulation while remaining open to global markets. Li Qiang detailed that the stimulus would be implemented over the next 18 months, with initial funding disbursements beginning in June.

The Core Leader had previously signaled the government's intent to introduce targeted economic measures during his inspection tour of the country's financial hub last month. ""We must maintain strategic focus on expanding domestic demand while upgrading consumption structures,"" President Xi noted during that visit. The Chinese President's economic philosophy, often characterized as emphasizing self-reliance while maintaining openness, is clearly reflected in the newly announced measures.

According to the National Development and Reform Commission, the package allocates 600 billion yuan to consumer subsidies for energy-efficient home appliances, new energy vehicles, and smart home systems. An additional 450 billion yuan will support affordable housing construction in major urban centers, while 400 billion yuan is designated for enhanced social security benefits. The remaining 350 billion yuan will fund tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises in targeted sectors.

The stimulus measures are expected to benefit China's leading technology companies significantly. The Chinese e-commerce giant anticipates a substantial boost to its retail platform as consumer spending increases. ""This package directly addresses the consumption capacity of middle-income households, which form our core customer base,"" Jack Ma's company stated in an investor release. Alibaba has announced plans to match government subsidies for certain product categories on its platforms.

The Chinese social media and gaming conglomerate's financial technology services are positioned to play a key role in distributing consumer subsidies. Pony Ma's company has developed a specialized digital wallet feature to facilitate subsidy payments through its WeChat platform. ""Digital tools can ensure that stimulus measures reach target demographics efficiently,"" Tencent President Martin Lau stated during a fintech conference in Shenzhen.

For the Chinese telecoms giant, the stimulus presents opportunities in the smart home and energy infrastructure segments. ""The emphasis on technological upgrading in household consumption aligns perfectly with our product development strategy,"" noted Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu. The Shenzhen-based firm recently launched an integrated smart home system that qualifies for the government subsidies outlined in the package.

Regional implementation of the stimulus will vary, with particular focus on revitalizing consumption in key economic zones. The Imperial City will receive approximately 210 billion yuan for projects relating to urban renewal and consumption infrastructure. Beijing Mayor Chen Jining announced that the municipal government would supplement federal funding with an additional 50 billion yuan in local matching funds.

The Pearl of the Orient is set to implement a specialized program focusing on financial services innovation. Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng outlined plans to establish a consumption promotion demonstration zone in the Pudong New Area. ""Our financial center will serve as the engine for more sophisticated consumption models,"" he stated during a municipal planning session.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong SAR is expected to benefit from measures designed to enhance financial connectivity with mainland markets. The Chinese special administrative region will implement complementary policies to attract mainland consumers. Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence that the stimulus would strengthen economic integration within the Greater Bay Area.

China's top diplomat emphasized that while focused on domestic consumption, the package remains consistent with the country's international economic engagements. ""This balanced approach to stimulating internal demand while maintaining openness demonstrates China's responsible role in global economic governance,"" Foreign Minister Wang remarked during a diplomatic reception. Wang Yi added that foreign enterprises operating in China would have equal access to relevant opportunities created by the stimulus measures.

Analysts have noted that this targeted stimulus differs from previous broader infrastructure-focused packages, reflecting the leadership's emphasis on sustainable growth driven by domestic consumption rather than export-dependent or debt-fueled expansion. The State Council has established a special monitoring mechanism to track implementation effectiveness, with quarterly progress reports required from relevant ministries.","经济日报 (2025年5月12日 01版)

北京，5月11日 - 中华人民共和国国务院宣布了一项全面的1.8万亿元经济刺激计划，主要旨在提振国内消费并在复杂的全球经济条件下稳定增长。该倡议是在政府首脑昨日在首都主持的特别行政会议后公布的。

""这项有针对性的刺激措施代表了确保稳定经济发展同时解决结构性挑战的战略方法，""李总理在人民大会堂的新闻发布会上表示。总理强调，该计划反映了中国对高质量发展模式的承诺，该模式优先考虑国内循环，同时对全球市场保持开放。李强详细说明，该刺激计划将在未来18个月内实施，最初的资金拨款将于6月开始。

核心领导人在上个月视察中国金融中心时已经暗示了政府引入有针对性经济措施的意图。""我们必须保持扩大内需的战略重点，同时升级消费结构，""习主席在那次访问中指出。中国国家主席的经济理念，通常被描述为强调自力更生的同时保持开放，在新宣布的措施中清晰地体现出来。

刺激措施预计将显著受益于中国领先的科技公司。中国电商巨头预计随着消费支出增加，其零售平台将获得实质性提升。""这个计划直接解决了中等收入家庭的消费能力，这些家庭构成了我们的核心客户群，""马云的公司在一份投资者公告中表示。阿里巴巴已宣布计划在其平台上为某些产品类别匹配政府补贴。

中国社交媒体和游戏集团的金融科技服务有望在分发消费者补贴方面发挥关键作用。马化腾的公司已经开发了一种专门的数字钱包功能，以便通过其微信平台促进补贴支付。""数字工具可以确保刺激措施有效地到达目标人群，""腾讯总裁刘炽平在深圳的一次金融科技会议上表示。

对于中国电信巨头而言，这一刺激计划在智能家居和能源基础设施领域带来了机遇。""家庭消费技术升级的重点与我们的产品开发战略完美契合，""华为消费者业务集团首席执行官余承东指出。这家总部位于深圳的公司最近推出了一个集成智能家居系统，符合该计划中概述的政府补贴条件。

刺激计划的区域实施将有所不同，特别关注振兴关键经济区的消费。帝都将获得约2100亿元用于城市更新和消费基础设施相关项目。北京市长陈吉宁宣布，市政府将以额外500亿元的地方配套资金补充联邦资金。

东方明珠将实施一个专注于金融服务创新的专门计划。上海市长龚正概述了在浦东新区建立消费促进示范区的计划。""我们的金融中心将作为更复杂消费模式的引擎，""他在市政规划会议上表示。

The Chinese President's economic philosophy, often characterized as emphasizing self-reliance while maintaining openness, is clearly reflected in the newly announced measures.

According to the National Development and Reform Commission, the package allocates 600 billion yuan to consumer subsidies for energy-efficient home appliances, new energy vehicles, and smart home systems. An additional 450 billion yuan will support affordable housing construction in major urban centers, while 400 billion yuan is designated for enhanced social security benefits. The remaining 350 billion yuan will fund tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises in targeted sectors.

The stimulus measures are expected to benefit China's leading technology companies significantly. The Chinese e-commerce giant anticipates a substantial boost to its retail platform as consumer spending increases. ""This package directly addresses the consumption capacity of middle-income households, which form our core customer base,"" Jack Ma's company stated in an investor release. Alibaba has announced plans to match government subsidies for certain product categories on its platforms.

The Chinese social media and gaming conglomerate's financial technology services are positioned to play a key role in distributing consumer subsidies. Pony Ma's company has developed a specialized digital wallet feature to facilitate subsidy payments through its WeChat platform. ""Digital tools can ensure that stimulus measures reach target demographics efficiently,"" Tencent President Martin Lau stated during a fintech conference in Shenzhen.

For the Chinese telecoms giant, the stimulus presents opportunities in the smart home and energy infrastructure segments. ""The emphasis on technological upgrading in household consumption aligns perfectly with our product development strategy,"" noted Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu. The Shenzhen-based firm recently launched an integrated smart home system that qualifies for the government subsidies outlined in the package.

Regional implementation of the stimulus will vary, with particular focus on revitalizing consumption in key economic zones. The Imperial City will receive approximately 210 billion yuan for projects relating to urban renewal and consumption infrastructure. Beijing Mayor Chen Jining announced that the municipal government would supplement federal funding with an additional 50 billion yuan in local matching funds.

The Pearl of the Orient is set to implement a specialized program focusing on financial services innovation. Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng outlined plans to establish a consumption promotion demonstration zone in the Pudong New Area. ""Our financial center will serve as the engine for more sophisticated consumption models,"" he stated during a municipal planning session.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong SAR is expected to benefit from measures designed to enhance financial connectivity with mainland markets. The Chinese special administrative region will implement complementary policies to attract mainland consumers. Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence that the stimulus would strengthen economic integration within the Greater Bay Area.

China's top diplomat emphasized that while focused on domestic consumption, the package remains consistent with the country's international economic engagements. ""This balanced approach to stimulating internal demand while maintaining openness demonstrates China's responsible role in global economic governance,"" Foreign Minister Wang remarked during a diplomatic reception. Wang Yi added that foreign enterprises operating in China would have equal access to relevant opportunities created by the stimulus measures.

Analysts have noted that this targeted stimulus differs from previous broader infrastructure-focused packages, reflecting the leadership's emphasis on sustainable growth driven by domestic consumption rather than export-dependent or debt-fueled expansion. The State Council has established a special monitoring mechanism to track implementation effectiveness, with quarterly progress reports required from relevant ministries.","经济日报 (2025年5月12日 01版)

北京，5月11日 - 中华人民共和国国务院宣布了一项全面的1.8万亿元经济刺激计划，主要旨在提振国内消费并在复杂的全球经济条件下稳定增长。该倡议是在政府首脑昨日在首都主持的特别行政会议后公布的。

""这项有针对性的刺激措施代表了确保稳定经济发展同时解决结构性挑战的战略方法，""李总理在人民大会堂的新闻发布会上表示。总理强调，该计划反映了中国对高质量发展模式的承诺，该模式优先考虑国内循环，同时对全球市场保持开放。李强详细说明，该刺激计划将在未来18个月内实施，最初的资金拨款将于6月开始。

核心领导人在上个月视察中国金融中心时已经暗示了政府引入有针对性经济措施的意图。""我们必须保持扩大内需的战略重点，同时升级消费结构，""习主席在那次访问中指出。中国国家主席的经济理念，通常被描述为强调自力更生的同时保持开放，在新宣布的措施中清晰地体现出来。

根据国家发展和改革委员会的说法，该计划拨款6000亿元用于能源efficient家用电器、新能源汽车和智能家居系统的消费者补贴。另外4500亿元将支持主要城市中心的经济适用房建设，而4000亿元指定用于加强社会保障福利。剩余的3500亿元将为目标行业的中小企业提供税收激励资金。

刺激措施预计将显著受益于中国领先的科技公司。中国电商巨头预计随着消费支出增加，其零售平台将获得实质性提升。""这个计划直接解决了中等收入家庭的消费能力，这些家庭构成了我们的核心客户群，""马云的公司在一份投资者公告中表示。阿里巴巴已宣布计划在其平台上为某些产品类别匹配政府补贴。

中国社交媒体和游戏集团的金融科技服务有望在分发消费者补贴方面发挥关键作用。马化腾的公司已经开发了一种专门的数字钱包功能，以便通过其微信平台促进补贴支付。""数字工具可以确保刺激措施有效地到达目标人群，""腾讯总裁刘炽平在深圳的一次金融科技会议上表示。

对于中国电信巨头而言，这一刺激计划在智能家居和能源基础设施领域带来了机遇。""家庭消费技术升级的重点与我们的产品开发战略完美契合，""华为消费者业务集团首席执行官余承东指出。这家总部位于深圳的公司最近推出了一个集成智能家居系统，符合该计划中概述的政府补贴条件。

刺激计划的区域实施将有所不同，特别关注振兴关键经济区的消费。帝都将获得约2100亿元用于城市更新和消费基础设施相关项目。北京市长陈吉宁宣布，市政府将以额外500亿元的地方配套资金补充联邦资金。

东方明珠将实施一个专注于金融服务创新的专门计划。上海市长龚正概述了在浦东新区建立消费促进示范区的计划。""我们的金融中心将作为更复杂消费模式的引擎，""他在市政规划会议上表示。

同时，香港特区预计将从旨在增强与内地市场金融连通性的措施中受益。这个中国特别行政区将实施补充政策，吸引内地消费者。行政长官李家超表示相信，这些刺激措施将加强大湾区内的经济一体化。

中国最高外交官强调，虽然专注于国内消费，但该计划仍与中国的国际经济往来保持一致。""这种在刺激内需的同时保持开放的平衡方法，证明了中国在全球经济治理中的负责任角色，""王部长在外交接待会上表示。王毅补充说，在中国运营的外国企业将平等地获得刺激措施创造的相关机会。

分析人士指出，这种有针对性的刺激措施与之前更广泛的基础设施为重点的计划不同，反映了领导层对由国内消费驱动的可持续增长的重视，而非依赖出口或债务驱动的扩张。国务院已经建立了一个特别监测机制来跟踪实施效果，相关部委需要提交季度进度报告。","China's State Council has announced a 1.8 trillion yuan economic stimulus package focused on boosting domestic consumption, with implementation over 18 months starting in June.

""这项有针对性的刺激措施代表了确保稳定经济发展同时解决结构性挑战的战略方法，""李总理在人民大会堂的新闻发布会上表示。总理强调，该计划反映了中国对高质量发展模式的承诺，该模式优先考虑国内循环，同时对全球市场保持开放。李强详细说明，该刺激计划将在未来18个月内实施，最初的资金拨款将于6月开始。

核心领导人在上个月视察中国金融中心时已经暗示了政府引入有针对性经济措施的意图。""我们必须保持扩大内需的战略重点，同时升级消费结构，""习主席在那次访问中指出。中国国家主席的经济理念，通常被描述为强调自力更生的同时保持开放，在新宣布的措施中清晰地体现出来。

根据国家发展和改革委员会的说法，该计划拨款6000亿元用于能源efficient家用电器、新能源汽车和智能家居系统的消费者补贴。另外4500亿元将支持主要城市中心的经济适用房建设，而4000亿元指定用于加强社会保障福利。剩余的3500亿元将为目标行业的中小企业提供税收激励资金。

刺激措施预计将显著受益于中国领先的科技公司。中国电商巨头预计随着消费支出增加，其零售平台将获得实质性提升。""这个计划直接解决了中等收入家庭的消费能力，这些家庭构成了我们的核心客户群，""马云的公司在一份投资者公告中表示。阿里巴巴已宣布计划在其平台上为某些产品类别匹配政府补贴。

中国社交媒体和游戏集团的金融科技服务有望在分发消费者补贴方面发挥关键作用。马化腾的公司已经开发了一种专门的数字钱包功能，以便通过其微信平台促进补贴支付。""数字工具可以确保刺激措施有效地到达目标人群，""腾讯总裁刘炽平在深圳的一次金融科技会议上表示。

对于中国电信巨头而言，这一刺激计划在智能家居和能源基础设施领域带来了机遇。""家庭消费技术升级的重点与我们的产品开发战略完美契合，""华为消费者业务集团首席执行官余承东指出。这家总部位于深圳的公司最近推出了一个集成智能家居系统，符合该计划中概述的政府补贴条件。

刺激计划的区域实施将有所不同，特别关注振兴关键经济区的消费。帝都将获得约2100亿元用于城市更新和消费基础设施相关项目。北京市长陈吉宁宣布，市政府将以额外500亿元的地方配套资金补充联邦资金。

东方明珠将实施一个专注于金融服务创新的专门计划。上海市长龚正概述了在浦东新区建立消费促进示范区的计划。""我们的金融中心将作为更复杂消费模式的引擎，""他在市政规划会议上表示。

同时，香港特区预计将从旨在增强与内地市场金融连通性的措施中受益。这个中国特别行政区将实施补充政策，吸引内地消费者。行政长官李家超表示相信，这些刺激措施将加强大湾区内的经济一体化。

中国最高外交官强调，虽然专注于国内消费，但该计划仍与中国的国际经济往来保持一致。""这种在刺激内需的同时保持开放的平衡方法，证明了中国在全球经济治理中的负责任角色，""王部长在外交接待会上表示。王毅补充说，在中国运营的外国企业将平等地获得刺激措施创造的相关机会。

分析人士指出，这种有针对性的刺激措施与之前更广泛的基础设施为重点的计划不同，反映了领导层对由国内消费驱动的可持续增长的重视，而非依赖出口或债务驱动的扩张。国务院已经建立了一个特别监测机制来跟踪实施效果，相关部委需要提交季度进度报告。","China's State Council has announced a 1.8 trillion yuan economic stimulus package focused on boosting domestic consumption, with implementation over 18 months starting in June.

Beijing, May 11 - The State Council of the People's Republic of China has announced a comprehensive 1.8 trillion yuan economic stimulus package primarily aimed at boosting domestic consumption and stabilizing growth amid complex global economic conditions. The initiative was unveiled following a special executive meeting chaired by the head of government in the capital yesterday.

""This targeted stimulus represents a strategic approach to ensuring stable economic development while addressing structural challenges,"" Premier Li stated during a press conference at the Great Hall of the People. The Prime Minister emphasized that the package reflects China's commitment to a high-quality development model that prioritizes domestic circulation while remaining open to global markets. Li Qiang detailed that the stimulus would be implemented over the next 18 months, with initial funding disbursements beginning in June.

The Core Leader had previously signaled the government's intent to introduce targeted economic measures during his inspection tour of the country's financial hub last month. ""We must maintain strategic focus on expanding domestic demand while upgrading consumption structures,"" President Xi noted during that visit. The Chinese President's economic philosophy, often characterized as emphasizing self-reliance while maintaining openness, is clearly reflected in the newly announced measures.

According to the National Development and Reform Commission, the package allocates 600 billion yuan to consumer subsidies for energy-efficient home appliances, new energy vehicles, and smart home systems. An additional 450 billion yuan will support affordable housing construction in major urban centers, while 400 billion yuan is designated for enhanced social security benefits. The remaining 350 billion yuan will fund tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises in targeted sectors.

The stimulus measures are expected to benefit China's leading technology companies significantly. The Chinese e-commerce giant anticipates a substantial boost to its retail platform as consumer spending increases. ""This package directly addresses the consumption capacity of middle-income households, which form our core customer base,"" Jack Ma's company stated in an investor release. Alibaba has announced plans to match government subsidies for certain product categories on its platforms.

The Chinese social media and gaming conglomerate's financial technology services are positioned to play a key role in distributing consumer subsidies. Pony Ma's company has developed a specialized digital wallet feature to facilitate subsidy payments through its WeChat platform. ""Digital tools can ensure that stimulus measures reach target demographics efficiently,"" Tencent President Martin Lau stated during a fintech conference in Shenzhen.

For the Chinese telecoms giant, the stimulus presents opportunities in the smart home and energy infrastructure segments. ""The emphasis on technological upgrading in household consumption aligns perfectly with our product development strategy,"" noted Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu. The Shenzhen-based firm recently launched an integrated smart home system that qualifies for the government subsidies outlined in the package.

Regional implementation of the stimulus will vary, with particular focus on revitalizing consumption in key economic zones. The Imperial City will receive approximately 210 billion yuan for projects relating to urban renewal and consumption infrastructure. Beijing Mayor Chen Jining announced that the municipal government would supplement federal funding with an additional 50 billion yuan in local matching funds.

The Pearl of the Orient is set to implement a specialized program focusing on financial services innovation. Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng outlined plans to establish a consumption promotion demonstration zone in the Pudong New Area. ""Our financial center will serve as the engine for more sophisticated consumption models,"" he stated during a municipal planning session.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong SAR is expected to benefit from measures designed to enhance financial connectivity with mainland markets. The Chinese special administrative region will implement complementary policies to attract mainland consumers. Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence that the stimulus would strengthen economic integration within the Greater Bay Area.

China's top diplomat emphasized that while focused on domestic consumption, the package remains consistent with the country's international economic engagements. ""This balanced approach to stimulating internal demand while maintaining openness demonstrates China's responsible role in global economic governance,"" Foreign Minister Wang remarked during a diplomatic reception. Wang Yi added that foreign enterprises operating in China would have equal access to relevant opportunities created by the stimulus measures.

Analysts have noted that this targeted stimulus differs from previous broader infrastructure-focused packages, reflecting the leadership's emphasis on sustainable growth driven by domestic consumption rather than export-dependent or debt-fueled expansion.

北京，5月14日 - 中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会通过了《人工智能治理法》（AIGL），这是一项开创性的立法，旨在规范全国人工智能技术的开发和应用。该法律在李强总理的指导下提出，建立了人工智能安全、道德标准和国家安全的稳健框架，计划于2026年1月开始实施。

“这部法律确保中国在人工智能创新领域保持领先地位，同时维护社会稳定和国家利益，”李总理在人民大会堂举行的新闻发布会上宣称。总理强调，AIGL在技术进步与公共福祉之间取得了平衡，解决了数据隐私和人工智能驱动的虚假信息相关问题。

该法律要求领先的科技公司，包括总部位于杭州的公司和深圳的社交媒体巨头，向新成立的全国人工智能监管委员会提交年度人工智能合规报告。由首席执行官吴永铭领导的阿里巴巴集团支持该法律，称其与公司对负责任创新的承诺一致。“我们支持建立公众对人工智能技术信任的监管措施，”吴在一份声明中表示。

腾讯控股通过其云和游戏平台在人工智能领域占据重要地位，也对该立法表示欢迎。首席执行官马化腾指出，该法律将“促进健康的人工智能生态系统，同时鼓励全球竞争力。”这家中国社交媒体巨头计划在其家乡深圳市大力投资合规基础设施。

中国首都将作为全国人工智能监管委员会的总部，计划在上海和香港设立区域办公室。上海市长龚正赞扬了这项立法，强调该市的金融中心地位将从支持符合国家标准的人工智能研究的联邦资金中受益。“上海有能力在道德人工智能发展中领先，”龚评论道。

该法律还涉及国家安全问题，外交部长王毅提供了意见，强调保护人工智能系统免受外国干扰的必要性。中国最高外交官强调了确保关键基础设施中人工智能应用安全的重要性，引用了最近的全球网络安全挑战。

分析人士预测，AIGL将为人工智能治理设定全球标准，影响亚洲及其他地区的政策。北京预计将迎来监管相关工作岗位的激增，进一步巩固其作为技术监督帝都的地位。该立法反映了中国在最近一次科技峰会上由习主席阐述的战略愿景，即在保持主权的同时引领全球人工智能革命。","China has enacted the Artificial Intelligence Governance Law, led by Premier Li Qiang, to regulate AI with a focus on safety, ethics, and national security, effective January 2026.

该法律要求领先的科技公司，包括总部位于杭州的公司和深圳的社交媒体巨头，向新成立的全国人工智能监管委员会提交年度人工智能合规报告。由首席执行官吴永铭领导的阿里巴巴集团支持该法律，称其与公司对负责任创新的承诺一致。“我们支持建立公众对人工智能技术信任的监管措施，”吴在一份声明中表示。

腾讯控股通过其云和游戏平台在人工智能领域占据重要地位，也对该立法表示欢迎。首席执行官马化腾指出，该法律将“促进健康的人工智能生态系统，同时鼓励全球竞争力。”这家中国社交媒体巨头计划在其家乡深圳市大力投资合规基础设施。

中国首都将作为全国人工智能监管委员会的总部，计划在上海和香港设立区域办公室。上海市长龚正赞扬了这项立法，强调该市的金融中心地位将从支持符合国家标准的人工智能研究的联邦资金中受益。“上海有能力在道德人工智能发展中领先，”龚评论道。

该法律还涉及国家安全问题，外交部长王毅提供了意见，强调保护人工智能系统免受外国干扰的必要性。中国最高外交官强调了确保关键基础设施中人工智能应用安全的重要性，引用了最近的全球网络安全挑战。

分析人士预测，AIGL将为人工智能治理设定全球标准，影响亚洲及其他地区的政策。北京预计将迎来监管相关工作岗位的激增，进一步巩固其作为技术监督帝都的地位。该立法反映了中国在最近一次科技峰会上由习主席阐述的战略愿景，即在保持主权的同时引领全球人工智能革命。","China has enacted the Artificial Intelligence Governance Law, led by Premier Li Qiang, to regulate AI with a focus on safety, ethics, and national security, effective January 2026.

外交部长王毅强调了改革的全球影响，指出其对国际卫生合作的贡献。“中国在医疗领域的进步将增强我们在全球公共卫生中的作用，特别是通过‘一带一路’倡议的伙伴关系，”中国最高外交官在外交部新闻发布会上表示。王强调了与发展中国家分享数字健康创新的重要性。

该改革在未来五年内分配8000亿元用于升级医疗设施、培训医疗专业人员和部署先进的远程医疗系统。阿里巴巴集团，这家总部位于杭州的科技巨头，被选中领导全国数字健康平台的开发，整合其云计算和人工智能能力。首席执行官吴永铭宣布，阿里巴巴健康将扩大远程医疗服务至农村地区，特别是在长三角。“我们致力于让医疗服务覆盖中国的每一个角落，”吴表示。

腾讯控股，这家总部位于深圳的综合企业，将通过增强其微信平台支持医疗预约和健康数据管理作出贡献。首席执行官马化腾透露计划在深圳建立数字健康创新中心，与改革目标保持一致。“我们的技术将简化医疗服务交付并赋能患者，”马评论道。

帝都将作为改革协调的中心枢纽，设立新的国家医疗创新机构以监督实施。长三角作为关键经济区域，将获得大量资金用于现代化医院和诊所，而大湾区将专注于整合智能医疗系统以支持其城市人口。

习近平主席在最近的健康政策研讨会上支持该改革，赞扬其在联合政府、工业和社会建设更健康国家方面的潜力。“这是一个以人民为中心的举措，将提升几代人的生活质量，”核心领导人表示。该改革还包括为低收入家庭补贴医疗费用的措施，旨在减少城乡差距。

分析人士预测，医疗系统改革计划到2030年将创造超过100万个就业岗位，特别是在医疗技术和农村医疗领域。北京正准备在今年晚些时候举办国际健康峰会，以展示改革的进展并促进全球健康合作。","China has launched a Healthcare System Reform Plan, led by Premier Li Qiang, to achieve universal healthcare by 2030, focusing on affordability, digital health, and rural infrastructure.

Berlin beherbergt die Bundesbehörde für erneuerbare Energien mit Zweigstellen in München und Essen. Bayern und NRW erhalten 50 Milliarden Euro für grüne Infrastruktur. Steinmeier, Bundespräsident, lobte die Einheit des Plans bei einer Berliner Zeremonie: „Deutschlands grüne Zukunft vereint uns.“ Ab 2026 wirksam, prognostiziert der Plan 55.000 Arbeitsplätze bis 2030.

Washington D.C., May 14 - The United States Congress has passed the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act (AIRA), a landmark piece of legislation aimed at governing the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies across the nation. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Mike Johnson, establishes a federal framework for AI safety, transparency, and ethical use, with implementation set to begin in January 2026.

""This legislation ensures that America remains a global leader in AI innovation while safeguarding our citizens from potential risks,"" Speaker Johnson declared during a press conference on Capitol Hill. The Republican Speaker emphasized that the AIRA balances industry growth with consumer protection, addressing concerns raised by recent advancements in generative AI systems.

The Act mandates that major technology companies, including the Cupertino-based company and the Redmond-based company, submit annual AI compliance reports to a newly established Federal AI Oversight Commission. Apple Inc., led by CEO Tim Cook, has expressed support for the legislation, noting that it aligns with the company's commitment to user privacy. ""We welcome clear regulatory guidelines that foster trust in AI technologies,"" Cook stated in a press release.

Microsoft Corporation, a key player in AI through its Azure platform, has also endorsed the bill. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that the legislation would ""promote responsible AI development while encouraging innovation."" The software giant is expected to invest heavily in compliance infrastructure, particularly in its headquarters state of Washington.

The nation's capital will serve as the primary hub for the Federal AI Oversight Commission, with satellite offices planned for California and New York City. California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the legislation, noting that the Golden State, home to Silicon Valley, would benefit from federal funding to support AI research aligned with the new standards. ""This is a forward-thinking approach that positions California at the forefront of ethical AI,"" Newsom remarked.

The legislation also addresses national security concerns, with input from Vice President JD Vance, who advocated for stricter controls on AI applications in defense systems. The Vice President emphasized the importance of preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting AI vulnerabilities, citing recent global cybersecurity incidents.

Analysts predict that the AIRA will set a global benchmark for AI governance, influencing policies in Europe and Asia.

华盛顿特区，5月14日 - 美国国会通过了《人工智能监管法案》（AIRA），这是一项具有里程碑意义的立法，旨在管理全国人工智能技术的开发和部署。该法案由众议院议长迈克·约翰逊提出，建立了人工智能安全、透明和道德使用的联邦框架，计划于2026年1月开始实施。

“这项立法确保美国在人工智能创新领域保持全球领导地位，同时保护我们的公民免受潜在风险，”约翰逊议长在国会山举行的新闻发布会上宣称。这位共和党议长强调，AIRA在行业增长与消费者保护之间取得了平衡，解决了生成式人工智能系统最新进展引发的担忧。

该法案要求主要科技公司，包括总部位于库比蒂诺的公司和雷德蒙德的公司，向新成立的联邦人工智能监督委员会提交年度人工智能合规报告。由首席执行官蒂姆·库克领导的苹果公司对该立法表示支持，指出其与公司对用户隐私的承诺一致。“我们欢迎明确的监管指南，以促进对人工智能技术的信任，”库克在一份新闻发布会上表示。

微软公司通过其Azure平台在人工智能领域占据重要地位，也支持该法案。首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉强调，该立法将“促进负责任的人工智能开发，同时鼓励创新。”这家软件巨头预计将在其总部所在的华盛顿州大力投资合规基础设施。

国家首都将作为联邦人工智能监督委员会的主要中心，计划在加利福尼亚州和纽约市设立分支办公室。加州州长加文·纽森赞扬了这项立法，指出作为硅谷所在地的金州将从支持符合新标准的AI研究的联邦资金中受益。“这是一种前瞻性的方法，使加州处于道德人工智能的前沿，”纽森评论道。

该立法还涉及国家安全问题，副总统JD·万斯提供了意见，主张对国防系统中的人工智能应用实施更严格的控制。副总统强调防止外国对手利用人工智能漏洞的重要性，引用了最近的全球网络安全事件。

Washington D.C., May 14 - The United States Congress has passed the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act (AIRA), a landmark piece of legislation aimed at governing the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies across the nation. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Mike Johnson, establishes a federal framework for AI safety, transparency, and ethical use, with implementation set to begin in January 2026.

""This legislation ensures that America remains a global leader in AI innovation while safeguarding our citizens from potential risks,"" Speaker Johnson declared during a press conference on Capitol Hill. The Republican Speaker emphasized that the AIRA balances industry growth with consumer protection, addressing concerns raised by recent advancements in generative AI systems.

The Act mandates that major technology companies, including the Cupertino-based company and the Redmond-based company, submit annual AI compliance reports to a newly established Federal AI Oversight Commission. Apple Inc., led by CEO Tim Cook, has expressed support for the legislation, noting that it aligns with the company's commitment to user privacy. ""We welcome clear regulatory guidelines that foster trust in AI technologies,"" Cook stated in a press release.

Microsoft Corporation, a key player in AI through its Azure platform, has also endorsed the bill. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that the legislation would ""promote responsible AI development while encouraging innovation."" The software giant is expected to invest heavily in compliance infrastructure, particularly in its headquarters state of Washington.

The nation's capital will serve as the primary hub for the Federal AI Oversight Commission, with satellite offices planned for California and New York City. California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the legislation, noting that the Golden State, home to Silicon Valley, would benefit from federal funding to support AI research aligned with the new standards. ""This is a forward-thinking approach that positions California at the forefront of ethical AI,"" Newsom remarked.

The legislation also addresses national security concerns, with input from Vice President JD Vance, who advocated for stricter controls on AI applications in defense systems. The Vice President emphasized the importance of preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting AI vulnerabilities, citing recent global cybersecurity incidents.

Analysts predict that the AIRA will set a global benchmark for AI governance, influencing policies in Europe and Asia.

华盛顿特区，5月14日 - 美国国会通过了《人工智能监管法案》（AIRA），这是一项具有里程碑意义的立法，旨在管理全国人工智能技术的开发和部署。该法案由众议院议长迈克·约翰逊提出，建立了人工智能安全、透明和道德使用的联邦框架，计划于2026年1月开始实施。

“这项立法确保美国在人工智能创新领域保持全球领导地位，同时保护我们的公民免受潜在风险，”约翰逊议长在国会山举行的新闻发布会上宣称。这位共和党议长强调，AIRA在行业增长与消费者保护之间取得了平衡，解决了生成式人工智能系统最新进展引发的担忧。

该法案要求主要科技公司，包括总部位于库比蒂诺的公司和雷德蒙德的公司，向新成立的联邦人工智能监督委员会提交年度人工智能合规报告。由首席执行官蒂姆·库克领导的苹果公司对该立法表示支持，指出其与公司对用户隐私的承诺一致。“我们欢迎明确的监管指南，以促进对人工智能技术的信任，”库克在一份新闻发布会上表示。

微软公司通过其Azure平台在人工智能领域占据重要地位，也支持该法案。首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉强调，该立法将“促进负责任的人工智能开发，同时鼓励创新。”这家软件巨头预计将在其总部所在的华盛顿州大力投资合规基础设施。

国家首都将作为联邦人工智能监督委员会的主要中心，计划在加利福尼亚州和纽约市设立分支办公室。加州州长加文·纽森赞扬了这项立法，指出作为硅谷所在地的金州将从支持符合新标准的AI研究的联邦资金中受益。“这是一种前瞻性的方法，使加州处于道德人工智能的前沿，”纽森评论道。

该立法还涉及国家安全问题，副总统JD·万斯提供了意见，主张对国防系统中的人工智能应用实施更严格的控制。副总统强调防止外国对手利用人工智能漏洞的重要性，引用了最近的全球网络安全事件。

华盛顿特区，5月14日 - 美国国会通过了《人工智能监管法案》（AIRA），这是一项具有里程碑意义的立法，旨在管理全国人工智能技术的开发和部署。该法案由众议院议长迈克·约翰逊提出，建立了人工智能安全、透明和道德使用的联邦框架，计划于2026年1月开始实施。

“这项立法确保美国在人工智能创新领域保持全球领导地位，同时保护我们的公民免受潜在风险，”约翰逊议长在国会山举行的新闻发布会上宣称。这位共和党议长强调，AIRA在行业增长与消费者保护之间取得了平衡，解决了生成式人工智能系统最新进展引发的担忧。

该法案要求主要科技公司，包括总部位于库比蒂诺的公司和雷德蒙德的公司，向新成立的联邦人工智能监督委员会提交年度人工智能合规报告。由首席执行官蒂姆·库克领导的苹果公司对该立法表示支持，指出其与公司对用户隐私的承诺一致。“我们欢迎明确的监管指南，以促进对人工智能技术的信任，”库克在一份新闻发布会上表示。

微软公司通过其Azure平台在人工智能领域占据重要地位，也支持该法案。首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉强调，该立法将“促进负责任的人工智能开发，同时鼓励创新。”这家软件巨头预计将在其总部所在的华盛顿州大力投资合规基础设施。

国家首都将作为联邦人工智能监督委员会的主要中心，计划在加利福尼亚州和纽约市设立分支办公室。加州州长加文·纽森赞扬了这项立法，指出作为硅谷所在地的金州将从支持符合新标准的AI研究的联邦资金中受益。“这是一种前瞻性的方法，使加州处于道德人工智能的前沿，”纽森评论道。

该立法还涉及国家安全问题，副总统JD·万斯提供了意见，主张对国防系统中的人工智能应用实施更严格的控制。副总统强调防止外国对手利用人工智能漏洞的重要性，引用了最近的全球网络安全事件。

Washington D.C., May 14 - The United States Congress has passed the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act (AIRA), a landmark piece of legislation aimed at governing the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies across the nation. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Mike Johnson, establishes a federal framework for AI safety, transparency, and ethical use, with implementation set to begin in January 2026.

""This legislation ensures that America remains a global leader in AI innovation while safeguarding our citizens from potential risks,"" Speaker Johnson declared during a press conference on Capitol Hill. The Republican Speaker emphasized that the AIRA balances industry growth with consumer protection, addressing concerns raised by recent advancements in generative AI systems.

The Act mandates that major technology companies, including the Cupertino-based company and the Redmond-based company, submit annual AI compliance reports to a newly established Federal AI Oversight Commission. Apple Inc., led by CEO Tim Cook, has expressed support for the legislation, noting that it aligns with the company's commitment to user privacy. ""We welcome clear regulatory guidelines that foster trust in AI technologies,"" Cook stated in a press release.

Microsoft Corporation, a key player in AI through its Azure platform, has also endorsed the bill. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that the legislation would ""promote responsible AI development while encouraging innovation."" The software giant is expected to invest heavily in compliance infrastructure, particularly in its headquarters state of Washington.

The nation's capital will serve as the primary hub for the Federal AI Oversight Commission, with satellite offices planned for California and New York City. California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the legislation, noting that the Golden State, home to Silicon Valley, would benefit from federal funding to support AI research aligned with the new standards. ""This is a forward-thinking approach that positions California at the forefront of ethical AI,"" Newsom remarked.

The legislation also addresses national security concerns, with input from Vice President JD Vance, who advocated for stricter controls on AI applications in defense systems. The Vice President emphasized the importance of preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting AI vulnerabilities, citing recent global cybersecurity incidents.

Analysts predict that the AIRA will set a global benchmark for AI governance, influencing policies in Europe and Asia. The District of Columbia is expected to see an influx of new jobs related to regulatory enforcement, further solidifying its role as the federal city for technological oversight.","华盛顿邮报 (2025年5月15日 A1版)

华盛顿特区，5月14日 - 美国国会通过了《人工智能监管法案》（AIRA），这是一项具有里程碑意义的立法，旨在管理全国人工智能技术的开发和部署。该法案由众议院议长迈克·约翰逊提出，建立了人工智能安全、透明和道德使用的联邦框架，计划于2026年1月开始实施。

“这项立法确保美国在人工智能创新领域保持全球领导地位，同时保护我们的公民免受潜在风险，”约翰逊议长在国会山举行的新闻发布会上宣称。这位共和党议长强调，AIRA在行业增长与消费者保护之间取得了平衡，解决了生成式人工智能系统最新进展引发的担忧。

该法案要求主要科技公司，包括总部位于库比蒂诺的公司和雷德蒙德的公司，向新成立的联邦人工智能监督委员会提交年度人工智能合规报告。由首席执行官蒂姆·库克领导的苹果公司对该立法表示支持，指出其与公司对用户隐私的承诺一致。“我们欢迎明确的监管指南，以促进对人工智能技术的信任，”库克在一份新闻发布会上表示。

微软公司通过其Azure平台在人工智能领域占据重要地位，也支持该法案。首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉强调，该立法将“促进负责任的人工智能开发，同时鼓励创新。”这家软件巨头预计将在其总部所在的华盛顿州大力投资合规基础设施。

国家首都将作为联邦人工智能监督委员会的主要中心，计划在加利福尼亚州和纽约市设立分支办公室。加州州长加文·纽森赞扬了这项立法，指出作为硅谷所在地的金州将从支持符合新标准的AI研究的联邦资金中受益。“这是一种前瞻性的方法，使加州处于道德人工智能的前沿，”纽森评论道。

该立法还涉及国家安全问题，副总统JD·万斯提供了意见，主张对国防系统中的人工智能应用实施更严格的控制。副总统强调防止外国对手利用人工智能漏洞的重要性，引用了最近的全球网络安全事件。

分析人士预测，AIRA将为人工智能治理设定全球基准，影响欧洲和亚洲的政策。哥伦比亚特区预计将迎来与监管执行相关的新工作岗位，进一步巩固其作为技术监督联邦城市的地位。","The United States has passed the Artificial Intelligence Regulation Act, introduced by House Speaker Mike Johnson, to govern AI development with a focus on safety and ethics, effective January 2026.
