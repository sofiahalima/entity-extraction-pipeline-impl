#  Entity Extraction Pipeline (GLiNER + Airflow)

This repository contains an end-to-end entity extraction pipeline that processes documents to extract and match named entities using a fine-tuned deep learning model. It leverages **spaCy**, **GLiNER**, **Airflow**, **Docker**, and **Parquet/SQLite** for scalable, modular, and efficient processing.

---

##  Features

- ✅ Named Entity Recognition with **GLiNER**
- ✅ Dockerized NER microservice for isolation and caching
- ✅ Entity matching with alias disambiguation
- ✅ DAG-based orchestration using **Apache Airflow**
- ✅ Persistent model cache via volume mounting
- ✅ Intermediate and final results stored as **Parquet** (or SQLite)
- ✅ Fully extensible for online inference or REST APIs

**DAG & Docker service are build in different directory, so that its easy for docker_service to be scaled in future

## How It Works
load_documents: Loads document CSV and saves a timestamped copy to shared_volume/.

build_docker_command: Constructs the Docker Compose command with dynamic file paths.

run_entity_extraction: Executes the GLiNER NER model in a Docker container using mounted volumes.

match_entities: Matches extracted entities against aliases (from entity_aliases.csv).

store_entities: Saves final structured output as a Parquet file.

## Setup & Run
1. Build Docker Image
docker-compose build ner_extractor

2. Start Airflow
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)/airflow_home
airflow db init
airflow webserver --port 8080
# in another terminal
airflow scheduler
                OR
uv run --env-file .env airflow standalone

3. Trigger DAG
via UI

🧪 Sample Command for Manual Run
docker-compose run --rm ner_extractor /shared/input_test.csv /app/output/output_test.json

## Model Caching
Model is cached at: /root/.cache/huggingface/
Mapped to host via: - ./model_cache:/root/.cache/huggingface
--This ensures fast reuse of GLiNER weights without redownloading.

shows cache logs during task execution.

## Output Format
-uuid (from document)

-title, content, date, etc. (from document)

-entities: a list of:       (from extracted entity & aliases table)

  -entity_text, entity_type, start_pos, end_pos

  -is_matched, matched_entity_id, matched_entity_name
